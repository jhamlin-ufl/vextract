# Source of data

Data were extracted from
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 016401 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.016401)
using vector-based extraction methods implemented in this project.

The files were produced by the notebooks:
- 05_MnS2.ipynb and
- 06_MnS2_higher_res.ipynb.

In the case of the higher_res file, the data was extracted from an older
draft version of the resistivity plot stored in a file called Fig2_tranport.pdf.
I have not included that file in the repository in order avoid potential
copyright issues.
