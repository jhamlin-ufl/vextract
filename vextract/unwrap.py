Functions related to unwrapping components of data.

    This is the core of the unwrapping method.
    It operates on two adjacent points.
    
    Take voltage at point i and add or subtract integer multiples of <shift>
    to V_{i} until (dV/dT)_{i} is as close as possible to (dV/dT)_{i-1}.
    Then return the the shifted value of V_{i}.

    this for unwraping voltages from susceptibility data.
